description: "Use when the user wants to create, update, or manage data products, publish or unpublish data products to a marketplace, manage marketplaces, enrich catalog metadata, add descriptions to tables or columns, set tags, set custom field values, check data product standards, manage product versions, or mark a version as ready. Also use for: product spec, product schema, delivery systems, record sets, marketplace badges, minimum standards, set up a new data product, define a product, annotate tables, enrich metadata. Use this skill any time the user mentions data products in a creation or management context, or wants to add/edit metadata on catalog objects. Not for querying data products — use ask. Not for browsing catalog — use explore. Not for creating data source connections — use configure."

# Curate

Manage data products, publish to marketplaces, and enrich catalog metadata.

## Routing

| User Intent | CLI Command | When to Use |
|---|---|---|
| Create/update/delete data products | `scripts/run-cli product` | Managing product specs and versions |
| Publish/unpublish to marketplace | `scripts/run-cli marketplace publish/unpublish` | Making products discoverable |
| Manage marketplaces themselves | `scripts/run-cli marketplace` | Creating or configuring marketplaces |
| Add descriptions/tags/custom fields | `scripts/run-cli enrich` | Enriching metadata on any catalog object |

## Not This Skill

- User wants to **query** a data product for answers → use `ask`
- User wants to **browse or search** data sources, the catalog, data products, or marketplaces → use `explore`
- User wants to **schedule** recurring queries against a product → use `automate`
- User wants to **create a data source connection** → use `configure`

Key distinction: `curate` manages data product definitions and metadata. `ask` runs queries against those products. "Create a data product" is `curate`. "Query a data product" is `ask`.

## Data Product Lifecycle

**First, check what you already have.** If a complete or near-complete spec is available (e.g. from `bi product-spec`, a user-provided JSON/YAML file, or a prior conversation step), use it as-is — do not discard its schema, record sets, or delivery systems. Only fall back to the empty-schema workflow when you are building a spec from scratch.

### When a spec is already available

1. **Review the spec** with the user. Confirm product ID, name, record sets, and schema look correct.
2. **Save the spec** as a JSON file (e.g. `spec.json`), then **create the product**:
   `scripts/run-cli product create < spec.json`
   If the spec is in YAML (e.g. from `bi product-spec`), convert it to JSON before saving.
3. Continue to **Mark version ready** and **Publish** below.

### When building from scratch

1. **Create product** with minimal spec (`"schema": []`):
   `scripts/run-cli product create < spec.json`
   See `references/product-schema.md` for the JSON schema.

2. **Discover columns** by querying the product (use the `ask` skill) or browsing the data source (use the `explore` skill).

3. **Update spec** with discovered schema:
   `scripts/run-cli product update < updated_spec.json`

### After creation (both paths)

4. **Mark version ready:**
   `scripts/run-cli product update-version PRODUCT_ID VERSION_ID --status ready`

5. **Publish to marketplace:**
   `scripts/run-cli marketplace publish --marketplace EXTERNAL_MARKETPLACE_ID --product ID`

## Metadata Enrichment

- `scripts/run-cli enrich list-fields` — see available custom fields
- `scripts/run-cli enrich get-values --otype table --oid 123` — see current values
- `scripts/run-cli enrich set-field --otype table --oid 123 --field-id 456 --value "description text"`
- Object types: `table`, `schema`, `attribute` (column), `data` (datasource)

## Common Mistakes

**Mistake:** Trying to publish a product whose version is still in "draft" status.
Why it seems reasonable: the product exists, so it should be publishable.
Instead: Check version status first. Mark it as "ready" before publishing.

**Mistake:** Setting `deliverySystems.type` to uppercase `"SQL"`.
Why it seems reasonable: the `dataAccess[].type` field IS uppercase.
Instead: `deliverySystems.type` must be lowercase `"sql"`. The `dataAccess[].type` must be uppercase `"SQL"`. Yes, this is inconsistent — see `references/product-schema.md`.

## Next Steps

After finishing curation, suggest next steps to the user — but don't proceed without
their go-ahead unless their original request already implies it.

- **After creating or updating a data product:** Share the product URL from the CLI response so the user can view it in the Alation UI.
- **After publishing a data product:** "Would you like to query this product? I can do that using the ask skill."
  If the user mentions recurring reports, suggest the **automate** skill to schedule queries.

## Red Flags
- "I'll populate the full schema upfront" — only when building from scratch. If a pre-populated spec was provided, use it as-is.
- "Let me set the product version to ready immediately" — only after the spec is complete and validated.
- "Let me strip the schema and start fresh" — if the spec already has schema/record sets, do not discard them.


## Ghast Safety Boundary

- Search, describe, standards checks, and metadata reads are read-only.
  Creating, updating, deleting, versioning, marking ready, publishing,
  unpublishing, marketplace changes, and metadata enrichment require an
  explicit user request.
- Before a write, show the exact product, version, marketplace, catalog object,
  field, and proposed value or status. Wait for confirmation, and require fresh
  confirmation for delete, publish, unpublish, bulk enrichment, or overwriting
  an existing value.
- Preserve governance and ownership metadata unless the user specifically
  requests a change. Never infer certification, quality, ownership, or policy
  status that the server did not return.
- Treat create, publish, and bulk enrichment operations as non-idempotent. Do
  not blindly retry ambiguous failures; verify the resulting object and status.
